            "question": "1. In the simulation, when you set n=2 and ℓ=1, what orbital type are you visualizing?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "2s orbital",
                "b": "2p orbital",

            },
            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. 2s would have ℓ=0, not ℓ=1.",
                "b": "Correct! When n=2 and ℓ=1, you are viewing a 2p orbital. The 'p' corresponds to ℓ=1.",
                "c": "Incorrect. 2d orbital doesn't exist because ℓ must be less than n, and d-orbitals have ℓ=2.",
                "d": "Incorrect. 1p doesn't exist because for n=1, the only possible ℓ value is 0."

            "question": "2. While using the simulation, you observed that the 3s orbital appears larger than the 1s orbital. This is because:",
            "answers": {
                "a": "3s has more electrons",
                "b": "Higher n means the electron is farther from the nucleus on average",
                "c": "3s has a different shape than 1s",
                "d": "The simulation is incorrectly scaled"
            },
            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. In hydrogen, there is only one electron regardless of the orbital.",
                "b": "Correct! As the principal quantum number (n) increases, the average distance of the electron from the nucleus increases, making the orbital larger.",
                "c": "Incorrect. Both s-orbitals are spherical; they differ only in size and number of radial nodes.",
                "d": "Incorrect. The simulation correctly shows that higher n orbitals are larger."

                "a": "Incorrect. We cannot know exact electron positions; this would violate the uncertainty principle.",
                "b": "Correct! The density of dots represents |ψ|², showing where the electron is most likely to be found. Denser regions indicate higher probability.",
                "c": "Incorrect. The visualization shows electron probability, not electric field.",
                "d": "Incorrect. The nucleus is represented by the central point, not the dot distribution."

            "answers": {
                "a": "The electron loses energy",
                "b": "The electron is less tightly bound to the nucleus",

            },
            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. Actually, the electron gains energy (becomes less negative = higher energy).",
                "b": "Correct! Less negative energy means the electron is less tightly bound. It takes less energy to remove an electron from a higher n orbital than from n=1.",
                "c": "Incorrect. Higher n means larger orbital, not smaller.",
                "d": "Incorrect. Higher n electrons actually move slower on average due to greater distance from nucleus."

                "a": "Incorrect. mₗ ranges from -2 to +2, giving more than 2 orbitals.",
                "b": "Incorrect. Three orbitals would be for p-subshell (ℓ=1), not d-subshell.",
                "c": "Correct! For ℓ=2, mₗ can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, giving 5 distinct d-orbitals.",
                "d": "Incorrect. Seven orbitals would be for f-subshell (ℓ=3)."

                "b": "A nodal plane where ψ = 0",

                "a": "Incorrect. While the nucleus is at the center, it doesn't 'separate' the lobes.",
                "b": "Correct! P-orbitals have a nodal plane passing through the nucleus where the probability of finding the electron is zero (ψ = 0).",
                "c": "Incorrect. There is no energy barrier; it's a region of zero probability.",
                "d": "Incorrect. Magnetic fields affect orbital orientation, not the node between lobes."

                "a": "Incorrect. ℓ cannot equal n; ℓ must be less than n.",
                "b": "Correct! For 4f orbital: n=4 and f corresponds to ℓ=3. The preset sets mₗ=0 as default.",
                "c": "Incorrect. ℓ cannot exceed (n-1), so ℓ=4 is not possible for n=3.",

            "question": "8. After completing the simulation, which statement best describes the relationship between quantum numbers and orbital properties?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "All quantum numbers equally affect only the energy",
                "b": "n affects size/energy, ℓ affects shape, mₗ affects orientation",
                "c": "Quantum numbers only affect the color of the visualization",

            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. Each quantum number has distinct effects on different properties.",
                "b": "Correct! This is the key takeaway: n determines size and energy, ℓ determines shape (s, p, d, f), and mₗ determines spatial orientation.",
                "c": "Incorrect. Colors in visualization are for display purposes; quantum numbers affect physical properties.",
                "d": "Incorrect. All three spatial quantum numbers (n, ℓ, mₗ) are necessary to fully describe an orbital."

                "a": "Incorrect. -13.6 eV is the ground state energy at n=1.",
                "b": "Incorrect. As n increases, energy becomes less negative, not more negative.",
                "c": "Correct! As n→∞, E = -13.6/n² → 0 eV. This represents complete ionization where the electron is free from the nucleus.",

                "a": "d-orbitals require at least 10 electrons",
                "b": "Because ℓ must be less than n, so for n=2, ℓ can only be 0 or 1",

                "a": "Incorrect. The existence of an orbital is independent of how many electrons fill it.",
                "b": "Correct! Since ℓ can range from 0 to (n-1), for n=2, ℓ can only be 0 (s) or 1 (p). ℓ=2 (d) would require n≥3.",
                "c": "Incorrect. D-orbitals exist for any atom with n≥3, not just transition metals.",
