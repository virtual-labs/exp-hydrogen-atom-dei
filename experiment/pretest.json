            },
            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. Electron spin is determined by the spin quantum number (mₛ), not the principal quantum number.",
                "b": "Correct! The principal quantum number (n) determines both the energy level and the size of the atomic orbital. Higher n means higher energy and larger orbital.",
                "c": "Incorrect. Atoms don't have inherent colors; colors arise from electron transitions between energy levels.",

            "explanations": {
                "a": "Incorrect. The maximum value of ℓ is (n-1), so for n=3, ℓ can be at most 2.",
                "b": "Incorrect. The azimuthal quantum number starts from 0, not 1.",
                "c": "Correct! For n = 3, ℓ can have values from 0 to (n-1), which means ℓ = 0, 1, or 2.",

                "a": "Incorrect. Dumbbell shape is characteristic of p-orbitals (ℓ = 1).",
                "b": "Correct! S-orbitals are spherically symmetric around the nucleus, meaning they have equal probability in all directions.",
                "c": "Incorrect. Cloverleaf shapes are characteristic of d-orbitals (ℓ = 2).",

                "c": "Correct! The ground state energy of hydrogen is -13.6 eV, calculated using E = -13.6/n² eV.",
