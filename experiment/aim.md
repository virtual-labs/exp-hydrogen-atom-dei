## Aim

To understand and visualize the different orbital structures of the hydrogen atom by:

1. Exploring the relationship between quantum numbers (n, ℓ, mₗ) and orbital properties
2. Observing the shapes of s, p, d, and f orbitals through interactive simulation
3. Understanding the concept of probability density distribution in atomic orbitals
4. Analyzing how energy levels change with principal quantum number
5. Gaining practical knowledge of wave function behavior in quantum mechanics
